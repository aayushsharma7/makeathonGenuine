Idea: High-quality education is free on YouTube but unstructured, our tool transforms any playlist/video into a complete course.

# 🎓 OpenCourse

> **Create Courses for Free. Learn Without Limits.**

OpenCourse is a platform designed to fix the fragmented way we learn online. It takes the chaos of YouTube playlists and transforms them into structured, distraction-free courses.

## 🚀 What Can You Do?

OpenCourse consolidates your entire study environment into one tab:

* **📚 Turn Playlists into Courses:** Paste a YouTube playlist link, and we instantly generate a structured course curriculum for you.
* **🤖 AI Doubt Solver:** Stuck on a concept? Ask our AI (powered by **Groq**) for instant, context-aware explanations without leaving the video.
* **💻 Inbuilt Code Editor:** Watching a coding tutorial? Practice the code right there in the browser. No need to Alt-Tab.
* **📝 Smart Notes:** Take organized notes that are linked to the video timestamps, helping you revise faster.
* **✍️ Interactive Whiteboard:** Visual learner? Draw diagrams and map out concepts on a digital whiteboard just like a classroom.
* **❓ Recommended Questions:** Test yourself with curated questions tailored to exactly what you're learning.
* ** Companion Extension:** Auto sync your progress even when you watch the video on youtube.
